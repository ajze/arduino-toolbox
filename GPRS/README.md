# GSM, GPRS and AT Commands

This module is using `StringBuffer<>` library.

The goal is to provide 2 classes:
 * a low level, non-blocking, `ATCmd` class that sends commands to the modem, listens for event and polls for completion.
 * a human friendly, blocking, `GPRS` class.
 
## ATCmd
 
```C++
  TODO
```
  
## GPRS
 
```C++
  TODO
```
